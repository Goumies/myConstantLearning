# How objects are utilized ?

## Adapter
Simple solution, easy to implement
Adapter typically provides multiple adapters
An adapter holds one single reference
Deals with legacy code
Works after code has been designed
Provides a different interface to legacy code that the one originally intended

Don't complicate
Don't add functionality

## Bridge
Designed upfront
Abstraction and implementation can vary independently
Complex but provides flexibility
Design for uncertainty
More than composition

Increases complexity
Conceptually difficult to plan
Can be confusing

Inheritance + Composition
Abstract Class + Interface through composition

## Composite

## Decorator

## Facade

## Flyweight

## Proxy
