# Maven fundamentals

## Build tool
Produces 1 Artifact (1 version of) :\
.jar / Component / ZIP file

Manages Dependencies

## Project Management Tool
Handles Versioning / Releases

Describes Project

Produces Javadocs / Site info

### Maven is Apache Software Foundation property
Is built with Maven (site generation plugin)
Open Source

## Why
Repeatable builds
DevOps / SysOps

Transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies)

Environment

Local repo for jars common to multiple projects

IDE and Standalone (command line)

Preferred method to work with build tools like Jenkins (CI)

### Ant VS Maven
Ant developed to replace Make, a not cross-platform build tool

Ant built on top Java and using XML = meant to be used in cross platform

Ant = verbose and imperative not-standard instructions = scripting tool

Maven = Full Featured tool

With lot of implicit functionality

Inheritance

Consistent across projects and platforms

Transitive dependencies (+++)

Versioned, it handles things by snapshot (added context)

= 1 of the main goals of its design
