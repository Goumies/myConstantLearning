# Maven : Structure

## Goals (commands)
`clean`       Deletes `/target` and its generated sources\
`compile`     Compiles all the source code and copy .properties file and generated skeletons (like web services) to `/classes`
`package`     Runs `compile`, runs unit tests and package that up, based on the type defined in pom.xml
`Ã¬nstall`     Download all the dependencies, runs `package` and install the resulted package in the local repository, default location /HOME/.m2
`deploy`      Runs `install` and deploys it to remote or corporate repository

## Overwriting goals : Build section
~/.m2/repository = Maven default storage
Stores artifact using info <groupId>/<artifactId>/<version>

`<finalName>helloMavenWorld</finalName>`

# Maven : Dependencies

List what we need thanks to <groupId>/<artifactId>/<version>

## Versions
Release number of the artifact we want to use
All internal developments should end with SNAPSHOT

SNAPSHOT                    the only specific naming convention = development in progress
Release                     no specific naming convention\
myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar      
myapp-1.0-M1.jar            M1 = milestone release
myapp-1.0-RC1.jar           RC1 = release candidate
myapp-1.0-RELEASE.jar       RELEASE
myapp-1.0-Final.jar

/!\ The build of a SNAPSHOT project will attempt to update every SNAPSHOT type dependency in the local repository

## Types
Packaging types
    pom, -jar, war, ear,- maven-plugin
    - - = glorified ZIP files

Dependency Pom
    dependency from a pom package

## Transitive dependencies
One of the reasons why people started using Maven
Dependencies required by the dependencies we need in our project

In case of conflict, the newer version is preferred

## Scopes (6)
compile         Default scope, all resources available everywhere in the app 
provided        Like compile, the artifact will be available during the entire build cycle
                => XML APIs, Servlet API, no servlet in the final artifact 
                = provided by the container that we are deploying our app to
                
runtime         needed for execution for dynamically loaded at runtime items 
                => Driver Manager resource bundled with the application using JDBC to connect to DB
                
runtime != provided

test            test compilation and execution phase only
                => JUnit or testNg jars
                
system          /!\ Never use it /!\
                = hard-coding a path to a jar in a system
                = exists to tie existing projects to Maven build
                
import          dependency management through several poms

## Repositories (HTTP locations)
### Local Repository
Maven storage

Super pom.xml in the Maven installation /!\ Never edit it /!\
    Default location repo.maven.apache.org (all the open-source projects)
    Ways to safely overwrite Super pom.xml = global parent project file our through the project pom.xml

Multiple repositories allowed and often encouraged
Corporate Repository is encouraged
    => Nexus (+++ for from scratch project) or Artifactory
    
## Dependency Repository
Dependencies download
Releases and / or snapshots
Separated repositories

`<repository>`

## Plugin Repository
Plugins download from Corporate repository
Usually separated repositories

`<pluginRepository>`

## Releases / Snapshots
Release process a little bit more work
Better separate non Production related files from releases
