# Maven : Structure

## Goals (commands)
`clean`       Deletes `/target` and its generated sources\
`compile`     Compiles all the source code and copy .properties file and generated skeletons (like web services) to `/classes`
`package`     Runs `compile`, runs unit tests and package that up, based on the type defined in pom.xml
`Ã¬nstall`     Download all the dependencies, runs `package` and install the resulted package in the local repository, default location /HOME/.m2
`deploy`      Runs `install` and deploys it to remote or corporate repository
